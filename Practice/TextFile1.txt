Version 2.0

Whats new:
*Game works, it is still in a basic and rough form. No user input on the screen yet, no randomisation as each number must be input when the object is created
*
*There is a static instance which counts the amount of user defined objects has been created. this updates every time an object constructor is called. 



Bulls and cows is a game where the player guesses 4 digits.
If the digit is in the correct spot, its a bull
If the digit is in the wrong spot but its a correct number, its a cow
No repeat numbers

Example:
Guess - 1234  Answer - 1593
1 bulls, 1 cows

Guess - 1234  Answer - 4153
0 bulls, 2 cows


Structure:

The program will be run as a user defined object, with a player inputing the guess by using the member function of the class. 
The number for now will be a pre defined one but in future games i will have it randomised after each correct guess so the game can be played in definetly
